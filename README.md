# Myanmar_Geospatial_Dataset
Demographics: This folder has all the input demographic files (in CSV formats) for each of the states and region as well as a nationally aggregated dataset

Existing Grid Network: This folder has GIS Shapefiles representing all the medium-voltage (MV) lines that were digitized based on paper maps (All_states_region_MVLine_tsp_level.shp)
There is also a GIS shapefile that is a combination of the above MV and some segments of the High Voltage (HV) transmission lines (All_MMR_Merged_MV_HV_Lines.shp)

Model Outputs:  This folder has all the tabular output files for each of the state and regions as well as a nationally aggregated output.
There is also a csv file with state/region specific input parameters that were used in the modeling (State_specific_Input_Parameters.csv)

Proposed Grid Network:  This folder contains the GIS shapefile representing the proposed medium-voltage network for the entire country based on the geospatial least-cost planning model

Final Report and Maps:   This folder contains the final draft report of the Myanmar National Electrification Plan (NEP): Least-Cost Geospatial Electrification Planning Results (MMR-NEP-Geospatial Least Cost Planning Draft FinalReport-2014-08-Annex4Removed.pdf)
There is also a list of country level maps (in PNG formats) that were produced during the course of the report.

Other Shapefiles:  This folder contains other additional shapefiles that were used during the project.
* Admin Boundaries from MIMU: GIS shapefile for all the administrative areas in Myanmar
o States/Regions > Districts > Townships >  Village Tracts

* Town Location:  GIS Shapefile with locations of major towns and cities
* GIS Shapefile for All rural and urban settlements (all_rural_urban_settlement_points.shp)
* GIS Shapefile showing all the  major  Roads in Myanmar (MMR_roads.shp)
